<h1>What Righteous Oaks Farm is About</h1>

<p>We seek to connect local farms to our community and be a resource for Christian ministry by providing a place for relationships to grow. Our theme verse is Isaiah 61:1-3</p>

<p><em>The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, because the LORD has annointed me to bring good news to the poor, he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound; to proclaim the year of the LORD's favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn; to grant to those who mourn in Zion - to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit; <strong>that they may be called oaks of righteousness,</strong> the planting of the LORD, that he may be glorified. (ESV)</em></p>

<p>We direct market most of our products to customers in our community and to the St. Paul/Minneapolis metro area. We sell off the farm, at the Aitkin Farmer's Market, and make deliveries to customers in the Twin Cities.</p>
